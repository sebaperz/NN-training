## 1. Building Blocks: Neurons

It takes inputs, **does some math with them**, and produces an output.

[A neuron](https://victorzhou.com/a74a19dc0599aae11df7493c718abaf9/perceptron.svg)
3 things happen here:
First, each imput is multiplied by a weight.
'''
$$
x1 -> x1*w1
x2 -> x2*w2
$$
'''
Next, all the weighted inputs are summed together.

Finally, the sum is passed through an activation function.
